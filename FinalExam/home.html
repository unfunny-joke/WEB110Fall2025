                        <h2>Who is Tyler, the Creator?</h2>
                        <p>Tyler Gregory Okonma, known better as Tyler, the Creator, is a rapper, singer, songwriter, producer (and about a dozen other things) who was born in Hawthorne, California. A visionary in the truest sense of the word, Tyler, the Creator has shook up the hip-hop genre for the better part of two decades now with his gravely voice and unapologetic lyricism. Once a small artist with a dedicated and passionate fanbase, Tyler, the Creator is now a global superstar with two Grammy wins and ten Grammy nominations and he doesn't seem to be slowing down any time soon.</p>

                <h2>A Brief Intro into Tyler, the Creator's Discography</h2>
                <p>With nine full-length studio albums spanning nearly two decades, Tyler, the Creator's discography is wide ranging and sonically diverse exploring many different genres, styles, and sounds. No two of his albums are quite the same, either in content or in overall sound.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You can follow Tyler, the Creator's growth both as a person (in the most literal sense, as he was only 18 at the time of his first albums release) and as an artist through his albums.</p>
