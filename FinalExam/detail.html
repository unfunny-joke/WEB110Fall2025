                        <h1><i>Bastard</i></h1>
                        <p>The red-headed stepchild of Tyler, the Creator's albums. <i>Bastard</i> is a polarizing album often described as 'horrorcore' and shock art and it's not hard to see why. Its lyrics are incredibly harsh and its themes are dark. If you haven't listened to it or Tyler's other early works before, be warned. It's not for the faint of heart.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>I'll admit, I've never listened to this album and honestly I don't really want to. It's not even on most streaming platforms and has all but been forgotten for a reason.</p>

                        <h3>Rating: 4/10</h3>
                        <p>Tyler, the Creator's second album, and the first of his mainstream albums, <i>Goblin</i> has received many of the same criticisms as <i>Bastard</i> though is more widely liked at least partially due to the singles 'Yonkers' and 'She' which are still popular today. Only slightly less harsh than <i>Bastard</i>, I still wouldn't play it around most people. It's few stand out songs definitely elevate the album in my mind, though as a whole it is one of my least favorite albums by him.</p>

                        <p><i>Wolf</i> was the first of Tyler, the Creators albums to really flex his creative muscles in my opinion. Shedding a lot (though not all) of the edgy, angst filled ramblings of a teenager that were present on his first two albums, <i>Wolf</i> was a huge jump for Tyler. <i>Wolf</i> also allowed us a peek behind the mask of a character present on <i>Bastard</i> and <i>Goblin</i>, into a more vulnerable side of Tyler. Many consider <i>Wolf</i> to be one of, if not the best album by Tyler, the Creator and while I don't agree personally, I wouldn't argue too much against someone who felt that way.</p>

                        <p>Tyler, the Creator's fourth album <i>Cherry Bomb</i>, was a bit of a pothole in his career. The album is rough, the mixing makes some of the songs unintelligible and hard to listen to, particularly in the first half of the album. The album is also all over the place and is one of the least consistent of his albums. All that being said though, I think it deserves more credit than it gets. <i>Cherry Bomb</i> shows Tyler really branching out and trying new things, especially in his production, even if some of it missed the mark. It's also the first album to drop the characters and just focus on the music. In hindsight, Cherry Bomb was a major stepping stone towards Tyler, the Creator becoming the artist he is today.</p>

                        <p><i>Cherry Bomb</i> may have been a pothole but it propelled Tyler, the Creator into massive success with his fifth album, <I>Flower Boy</I>. Its production is leaps and bounds above everything before it, the lyrics were emotional and personal, and overall the album feels like Tyler has really come out of his shell and it got him his first Grammy nomination. There are very few low points on this album and even the worst of it is still great. I may be biased as this was the first of Tyler, the Creator's albums I ever listened to at a very formative time in my life, but <i>Flower Boy</i> is truly some of the best Tyler, the Creator has to offer.</p>

                        <p><i>Flower Boy</i> was Tyler really coming into his own, but his sixth album, <i>IGOR</i>, was Tyler, the Creator perfecting his sound. <i>IGOR</i> is truly a work of art, a masterpiece even. A beautiful blend of top-notch production, intimate, emotional lyricism, and story telling more present in his earlier albums, many consider <i>IGOR</i> to be Tyler's magnum opus and I would agree. This album is Tyler, the Creator at his absolute peak as shown by it scoring him his first Grammy win.</p>

                        <p>Following the massive success of <i>IGOR</i>, Tyler, the Creator's seventh album, <i>Call Me If You Get Lost</i>, does feel like a bit of a step down on the whole. Which isn't to say the album is bad at all, but it feels like Tyler, the Creator's victory lap (which he more than deserved). The album is more playful and less serious than <i>IGOR</i> was. He was celebrating and having fun, and at the end of the day it got him his second Grammy win. Admittedly, I wasn't a huge fan of this album when it first came out, maybe because I had liked <i>IGOR</i> <b>so</b> much and this simply wasn't that. But it's grown on me over time and several of the songs have become some of my favorites.</p>

                        <p>Tyler, the Creator's seventh album <i>CHROMAKOPIA</i> sits in a weird place for me. It's far from my favorite of his works, but there's also nothing glaringly wrong with it. Honestly, I think my biggest issue with this album is it's just a bit boring for large parts of it and a bit all over the place. There are some great songs on this record, but a lot of them just felt a touch, lackluster. I like the themes of Tyler really coming to terms with his adulthood now that he's in his thirties (which I'm not saying is old) and the expectations that come with that. Overall, it's a good album but I can't help but feel like it could've been more, even if it still got four Grammy nominations.</p>

                        <p>The latest album by Tyler, the Creator, <i>Don't Tap the Glass</i> is a new avenue of exploration from Tyler. The album is mostly dance tracks, meant to be played in a club and let loose to. It's a fun album but it's not really for me. The rapping is good but the production isn't my favorite and the lyricism is quite repetitive, which is to be expected to some extent on a dance/club track. But, at the end of the day, it's always fun to see an artist try something new.</p>
